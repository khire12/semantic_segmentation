# Visual Learning - Semantic Segmentation

This code uses dataset from **Lyft Udacity Challenge of Semantic Semantation**. The dataset is generated by CARLA self-driving car simulator.
The data has 5 sets of 1000 images and corresponding labels.

In the code we have implementated two models from scratch
1. **Unet**
2. **Deep lab model**


### Results 

1. **Unet**
  - Train Accuracy: 98.34
  - Train Dice score: 8.354591369628906
  - Test Accuracy 97.24
  - Test Dice score: 8.32595157623291

2. **Deep lab model**
  - Train Accuracy: 88.35
  - Train Dice score: 7.973032474517822
  - Test Accuracy: 88.39
  - Test Dice score: 7.973648548126221
